Responsive motion transition for interactive control of Walking motion

We propose a set of walking motion data as input to be processed through a dynamic transitive method to produce the output as a smooth transition continuous
walking motion.

We determine the timing to perform correct
transition time and to solve foot constraints by
defining the key times of the motion to match both
foot movements while perform the blending phase.
